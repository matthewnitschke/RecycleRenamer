# RecycleRenamer
A non-destructive "virus". I use "virus" in quotes because it is not self replicating so technically not a virus.

Recycle Renamer simply renames the recycle bin to "Rubbish Bin". Because why not.

# Installation

1. Move the Renamer file to a hidden location. It doesn't matter where, I like to put it in AppData

2. Create a shortcut of the executer.bat file and set it to open minimized (found in properties)

3. Move that shortcut to the startup folder ("%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup")


Now each time the computer is booted the recycle bin will become "Rubbish Bin"
